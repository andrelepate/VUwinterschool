      "<h3><strong>The Causes of Loneliness at Work</strong></h3>\n",
      "<p>Loneliness is a <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=137534\">subjective feeling</a> of isolation. Number of coworker interactions and whether or not you work remotely are not causal factors. What matters is the <a href=\"http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/janedut/high%20quality%20connections/power%20high%20quality.pdf\">quality</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6631669\">meaningfulness</a> of relationships. It’s common for employees to feel lonely while surrounded by colleagues with whom they don’t genuinely connect. Indeed, do your colleagues see the real you or just a carefully managed, work-safe persona&nbsp;—&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idnJnjV_8rg\">a brilliant disguise</a>? If the latter, then you’re likely to suffering some degree of loneliness.</p>\n",
      "<p>Loneliness isn’t usually a failure of the employee but is, rather, a systemic cultural issue. Humans have a need to feel valued by the people around them at work, at home, and in the community. Yet many people keep work relationships at a distance because that’s what they believe is expected. Unless employers demonstrate they value basic human connections at work, it is difficult to change the common gospel that who you are is not who you should be in the office.&nbsp;<a href=\"/2011/04/strategies-for-learning-from-failure\">Psychological safety</a>&nbsp;— the sense that we can be free to be ourselves without fear of retribution&nbsp;— doesn’t exist when our managers don’t model vulnerability, a generator of high-quality connections, because they worry it might undermine their authority. Cultural norms that discourage genuine relationships lead to loneliness.</p>\n",
      "<h3><strong>How Peer Coaching Can Help</strong></h3>\n",
      "<p><a href=\"/2010/02/cultivate-your-coaching-networ-2\">Peer coaching</a> is about cultivating a network of allies that can provide mutual support in creating positive change to improve performance. In addition to its many <a href=\"https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/AMLE.2008.35882189\">benefits for learning</a>, these relationships address the roots of loneliness at work. On the surface, peer coaching might look like low-budget professional coaching. Employees gain new perspectives on their issues and opportunities, as well as accountability partners to improve follow-through on creating change, but without paying professional coaching fees. But it’s much more than that. When organizations invest in peer coaching systems they signal a cultural shift that normalizes talking candidly about life with colleagues. Employees gain feelings of connection, trust increases, and individuals develop insights into their own problems through helping others. Peer coaching provides opportunities for one-on-one connection and demonstrates that our inner lives are welcome in the workplace. Let’s explain a bit further three of the ways it helps:</p>\n",
      "<ul> \n",
      " <li><strong>Creates a culture that values connection</strong>. People develop symptoms of loneliness when they <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16594799\"><em>feel</em></a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16594799\"> isolated</a>, regardless of how much actual social support is available to them. Psychological problems increase when people have <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18633781\">little hope</a> for more connection in the future. An employer’s commitment to increasing connections among employees can reduce loneliness even before any coaching begins simply through the signals such initiatives convey. This is especially relevant for younger employees; <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-want-to-be-connected-to-their-coworkers-2013-6?IR=T\">71% of millennials</a> want their coworkers to be like a second family. When employers help employees build peer-to-peer coaching networks, it creates a culture of connection. Employees experience being vulnerable with coworkers and begin to view lowering their walls as an asset, not a liability. They see the workplace as a source of personal nourishment. Loneliness dissipates when we feel we are among people engaged in helping each other. As one of our clients said after a peer coaching exchange, <strong>“</strong>Just having someone who was truly interested in helping me was an incredibly powerful experience.”</li> \n",
      " <li><strong>Replaces social snacking with meaningful dialogue.&nbsp;</strong>Communicating mostly over email or chat and then turning to social media on breaks — that’s <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-13813-014\">social snacking,</a> which gives the illusion of connection without actual nourishment. What matters is not how often we interact, but whether our interactions are <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6631669\">meaningful</a>. Peer coaching replaces snacking with satisfying meals of real talk. Those at the table are revealing themselves and accepting others as they are. The reciprocal nature of peer coaching relationships, in which employees take turns talking about work in the context of their whole lives, is a <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167297234003\">catalyst for deep mutual understanding</a>. By providing opportunities for individuals to talk — without pressure to deliver or impress — peer coaching can reduce loneliness more effectively than staged social events in which people might be laughing and drinking but still hiding behind a mask they’d rather remove.</li> \n",
      " <li><strong>Increases psychological safety.&nbsp; </strong><a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/30038995?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">When researchers recently asked Americans “How many confidants do you have?</a>” the most common response was “zero,” compared to a modal response of “three” just two decades earlier. Research shows that people who are lonely, compared to those who are not, are <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0265407592092009\">less able to make new connections</a>. Because peer coaching involves repeated conversations with consistent partners, it is an effective method of creating confidants that persist over time.&nbsp; One of our clients said, “I feel like I gained three new family members, people who are supportive and non-judgmental.” Coaching focuses on listening and asking questions. Because participants in peer-to-peer coaching exchanges see their coaches as focused first and foremost on gaining understanding of what’s on the inside, these relationships produce feelings of psychological safety.</li> \n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<p>Once you are comfortable with the idea of doing something to deepen relationships at work, set up a simple method for two people to try out a peer-to-peer coaching exchange following <a href=\"/2015/03/how-to-get-your-team-to-coach-each-other\">these basic guidelines</a><u>.</u> Each pair can take turns coaching each other for 20 minutes each. In essence: Listen and don’t try to fix problems. Start with coaching sessions over lunch; eating together <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/02/02/512998465/why-eating-the-same-food-increases-peoples-trust-and-cooperation\">increases trust</a> and is a natural way to schedule a one-on-one that isn’t focused on specific work tasks. Be sure to check in on what people learn about how to be effective as coaches and as clients in their dialogues and use that knowledge to make needed adjustments.</p>\n",
      "<p>Peer coaching can be effective in fighting loneliness through opt-in one-on-one dialogues where the work of creating stronger human connections can happen.</p>\n",

Moving forward, strategically applying technology — alongside their own judgement, warmth, and integrity — will be an increasingly important way for them to do so. The authors describe four key areas where technology can transform the act — and the impact — of coaching: 1) Technology can help monitor progress towards goals against a clear baseline. 2) It can build a richer picture of what the client is saying (and not saying). 3) It can develop options based on scenarios, simulations, and extrapolations. 4) It can use “nudges” to encourage and reinforce target behaviors.   Mimi Haddon/Getty Images  Years ago, executive coaching was stigmatized as “remedial help for underperformers.” More recently, it’s transformed into an elite, high-cost activity, often reserved for the highest-status executives. But in both cases — whether helping the worst or the best performers — executive coaching has been inherently small scale, due to its bespoke, one-on-one nature. Organizations have increasingly embraced the idea of internal leaders providing more coaching to their direct reports.Now, technology is now making it possible for far greater numbers of employees to benefit from outside executive coaching at scale. At a basic level, platforms are making it easier to find and select a coach, to do long-distance coaching via video conferencing — or potentially even\\xa0holoportation in the future — and to manage the administration involved.Additionally, some “coaching tech” has enabled coaching conversations without the involvement of a human at a much lower cost. Bots, such as Pocket Confidant and People Squared, allow people to ask questions, work on simulation challenges, and practice their skills in competitive games. Technology and AI permit this to happen anytime and anywhere. Some companies, such as Axa and IBM, are encouraging their adoption to provide large-scale access to coaching.But perhaps the biggest impact of technology will come from how it enables individual executive coaches (or leaders who act as coaches) to better connect with and serve their clients.

      "{'title': ['How Peer Coaching Can Make Work Less Lonely'], 'text': [\"googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('DFP_TITLE_pos2'); });Loading...Executive SummaryLoneliness is a widespread, costly problem:\\xa0workplace loneliness causes burnout, affects job satisfaction, and lowers both performance and retention. It also increases health care costs. We often see loneliness as an individual problem, but really it’s a systemic problem that takes more than personal efforts to overcome. One way to help reduce loneliness? Peer coaching. Peer coaching can help foster feelings of psychological safety at work, replace “social snacking” with meaningful dialogue, and create a culture that fosters meaningful personal connections.   Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images  A near-constant stream of business and scientific news reminds us that 50% of Americans are lonely. Former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy’s powerful HBR article notes that half of CEOs suffer from loneliness. In addition to its personal toll, there is also an economic cost: workplace loneliness causes burnout, affects job satisfaction, and lowers both performance and retention. It also increases health care costs.The Causes of Loneliness at WorkLoneliness is a subjective feeling of isolation. Number of coworker interactions and whether or not you work remotely are not causal factors. What matters is the quality and meaningfulness of relationships. It’s common for employees to feel lonely while surrounded by colleagues with whom they don’t genuinely connect. Indeed, do your colleagues see the real you or just a carefully managed, work-safe persona\\xa0a brilliant disguise? If the latter, then you’re likely to suffering some degree of loneliness.Loneliness isn’t usually a failure of the employee but is, rather, a systemic cultural issue. Humans have a need to feel valued by the people around them at work, at home, and in the community. Yet many people keep work relationships at a distance because that’s what they believe is expected. Unless employers demonstrate they value basic human connections at work, it is difficult to change the common gospel that who you are is not who you should be in the office.\\xa0Psychological safety\\xa0— the sense that we can be free to be ourselves without fear of retribution\\xa0— doesn’t exist when our managers don’t model vulnerability, a generator of high-quality connections, because they worry it might undermine their authority. Cultural norms that discourage genuine relationships lead to loneliness.How Peer Coaching Can HelpPeer coaching is about cultivating a network of allies that can provide mutual support in creating positive change to improve performance. In addition to its many benefits for learning, these relationships address the roots of loneliness at work. On the surface, peer coaching might look like low-budget professional coaching. Employees gain new perspectives on their issues and opportunities, as well as accountability partners to improve follow-through on creating change, but without paying professional coaching fees. But it’s much more than that. When organizations invest in peer coaching systems they signal a cultural shift that normalizes talking candidly about life with colleagues. Employees gain feelings of connection, trust increases, and individuals develop insights into their own problems through helping others. Peer coaching provides opportunities for one-on-one connection and demonstrates that our inner lives are welcome in the workplace. Let’s explain a bit further three of the ways it helps:Creates a culture that values connection. People develop symptoms of loneliness when they feel isolated, regardless of how much actual social support is available to them. Psychological problems increase when people have little hope for more connection in the future. An employer’s commitment to increasing connections among employees can reduce loneliness even before any coaching begins simply through the signals such initiatives convey. This is especially relevant for younger employees; 71% of millennials want their coworkers to be like a second family. When employers help employees build peer-to-peer coaching networks, it creates a culture of connection. Employees experience being vulnerable with coworkers and begin to view lowering their walls as an asset, not a liability. They see the workplace as a source of personal nourishment. Loneliness dissipates when we feel we are among people engaged in helping each other. As one of our clients said after a peer coaching exchange, “Just having someone who was truly interested in helping me was an incredibly powerful experience.”Replaces social snacking with meaningful dialogue.\\xa0Communicating mostly over email or chat and then turning to social media on breaks — that’s social snacking, which gives the illusion of connection without actual nourishment. What matters is not how often we interact, but whether our interactions are meaningful. Peer coaching replaces snacking with satisfying meals of real talk. Those at the table are revealing themselves and accepting others as they are. The reciprocal nature of peer coaching relationships, in which employees take turns talking about work in the context of their whole lives, is a catalyst for deep mutual understanding. By providing opportunities for individuals to talk — without pressure to deliver or impress — peer coaching can reduce loneliness more effectively than staged social events in which people might be laughing and drinking but still hiding behind a mask they’d rather remove.Increases psychological safety.\\xa0 When researchers recently asked Americans “How many confidants do you have?” the most common response was “zero,” compared to a modal response of “three” just two decades earlier. Research shows that people who are lonely, compared to those who are not, are less able to make new connections. Because peer coaching involves repeated conversations with consistent partners, it is an effective method of creating confidants that persist over time.\\xa0 One of our clients said, “I feel like I gained three new family members, people who are supportive and non-judgmental.” Coaching focuses on listening and asking questions. Because participants in peer-to-peer coaching exchanges see their coaches as focused first and foremost on gaining understanding of what’s on the inside, these relationships produce feelings of psychological safety.Once you are comfortable with the idea of doing something to deepen relationships at work, set up a simple method for two people to try out a peer-to-peer coaching exchange following these basic guidelines. Each pair can take turns coaching each other for 20 minutes each. In essence: Listen and don’t try to fix problems. Start with coaching sessions over lunch; eating together increases trust and is a natural way to schedule a one-on-one that isn’t focused on specific work tasks. Be sure to check in on what people learn about how to be effective as coaches and as clients in their dialogues and use that knowledge to make needed adjustments.Peer coaching can be effective in fighting loneliness through opt-in one-on-one dialogues where the work of creating stronger human connections can happen.\", \"googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('DFP_TITLE_pos2'); });Loading...Executive SummaryLoneliness is a widespread, costly problem:\\xa0workplace loneliness causes burnout, affects job satisfaction, and lowers both performance and retention.

Unless employers demonstrate they value basic human connections at work, it is difficult to change the common gospel that who you are is not who you should be in the office.\\xa0Psychological safety\\xa0— the sense that we can be free to be ourselves without fear of retribution\\xa0— doesn’t exist when our managers don’t model vulnerability, a generator of high-quality connections, because they worry it might undermine their authority. Cultural norms that discourage genuine relationships lead to loneliness.How Peer Coaching Can HelpPeer coaching is about cultivating a network of allies that can provide mutual support in creating positive change to improve performance. In addition to its many benefits for learning, these relationships address the roots of loneliness at work. On the surface, peer coaching might look like low-budget professional coaching. Employees gain new perspectives on their issues and opportunities, as well as accountability partners to improve follow-through on creating change, but without paying professional coaching fees. But it’s much more than that. When organizations invest in peer coaching systems they signal a cultural shift that normalizes talking candidly about life with colleagues. Employees gain feelings of connection, trust increases, and individuals develop insights into their own problems through helping others. Peer coaching provides opportunities for one-on-one connection and demonstrates that our inner lives are welcome in the workplace. Let’s explain a bit further three of the ways it helps:Creates a culture that values connection. People develop symptoms of loneliness when they feel isolated, regardless of how much actual social support is available to them. Psychological problems increase when people have little hope for more connection in the future. An employer’s commitment to increasing connections among employees can reduce loneliness even before any coaching begins simply through the signals such initiatives convey. This is especially relevant for younger employees; 71% of millennials want their coworkers to be like a second family. When employers help employees build peer-to-peer coaching networks, it creates a culture of connection. Employees experience being vulnerable with coworkers and begin to view lowering their walls as an asset, not a liability. They see the workplace as a source of personal nourishment.

What matters is not how often we interact, but whether our interactions are meaningful. Peer coaching replaces snacking with satisfying meals of real talk. Those at the table are revealing themselves and accepting others as they are. The reciprocal nature of peer coaching relationships, in which employees take turns talking about work in the context of their whole lives, is a catalyst for deep mutual understanding. By providing opportunities for individuals to talk — without pressure to deliver or impress — peer coaching can reduce loneliness more effectively than staged social events in which people might be laughing and drinking but still hiding behind a mask they’d rather remove.Increases psychological safety.\\xa0 When researchers recently asked Americans “How many confidants do you have?” the most common response was “zero,” compared to a modal response of “three” just two decades earlier.

It also increases health care costs. We often see loneliness as an individual problem, but really it’s a systemic problem that takes more than personal efforts to overcome. One way to help reduce loneliness? Peer coaching. Peer coaching can help foster feelings of psychological safety at work, replace “social snacking” with meaningful dialogue, and create a culture that fosters meaningful personal connections.   Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images  A near-constant stream of business and scientific news reminds us that 50% of Americans are lonely. Former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy’s powerful HBR article notes that half of CEOs suffer from loneliness. In addition to its personal toll, there is also an economic cost: workplace loneliness causes burnout, affects job satisfaction, and lowers both performance and retention. It also increases health care costs.The Causes of Loneliness at WorkLoneliness is a subjective feeling of isolation. Number of coworker interactions and whether or not you work remotely are not causal factors. What matters is the quality and meaningfulness of relationships. It’s common for employees to feel lonely while surrounded by colleagues with whom they don’t genuinely connect. Indeed, do your colleagues see the real you or just a carefully managed, work-safe persona\\xa0a brilliant disguise? If the latter, then you’re likely to suffering some degree of loneliness.Loneliness isn’t usually a failure of the employee but is, rather, a systemic cultural issue.

Considering that a year’s engagement with a top executive coach can cost more than $100,000, it’s\\xa0an important question. There are four\\xa0red flags to watch out for. First, an executive who consistently blames external\\xa0factors for their problems may be too oblivious to benefit from coaching, which requires a modicum of self-awareness and introspection. Second, if you\\xa0struggle to get appointments with a coach on the executive’s calendar, it may be a sign that they won’t prioritize self-development enough to benefit from coaching. Third, watch out for a leader who over-focuses on quick solutions, tips, and tactics; the best candidates for coaching are more willing to challenge assumptions and beliefs, which is a longer process. And fourth, beware of managers who continually delay the start of coaching to “do more research” or “find the right person.” It may be a sign they’re just not ready to confront their issues.   HBR Staff/Image Source/Getty Images  The stigma of asking for or being assigned an executive coach is vanishing quickly. The growth of the industry tells us so. In the U.S. alone, $1 billion was spent on business, personal and relationship coaches last year, according to IbisWorld, up about 20% from five years earlier. And the number of business coaches worldwide has zoomed more than 60% since 2007, according to one coaching association. But while executive coaches have improved the performance of many already-good managers and sanded the rough edges off many less effective ones, they aren’t a miracle cure. In fact, we have seen many companies waste considerable sums by assigning coaches to managers who just aren’t ready to be coached, no matter how effective the coaches may be.So how do those who control the coaching purse strings\\xa0— HR, talent managers, and other buyers\\xa0— avoid throwing money away on uncoachable executives? Considering that a year’s engagement with a top executive coach can cost more than $100,000, it’s an important question.From nearly 35 years of coaching hundreds of executives, our firm has noticed a pattern of red flags that indicate when a coaching investment will be wasted. Here are\\xa0four things to watch out for:1. They blame external factors for their problems.When things go wrong, does this person always have an excuse? Maybe they point a finger at the quality of their team, a lack of resources, or even their boss.When leaders argue about the validity of your reasons for offering coaching, or offer excuses or defenses for poor results, it can be a sign that they lack self-awareness. Before any coaching can be effective,\\xa0they need to wake up to the ways\\xa0their actions affect others.One CEO we worked with was known for his smart turnarounds of a large media company. But he was struggling to get along with his executive team. Finally, several board directors suggested he should seek out a coach. After multiple sessions, he had shared little information about himself, and we were no closer to figuring out the root of the problem. Stymied, we suggested that we observe the next executive team meeting.Suddenly, all was clear. We were shocked by how he controlled the conversation in the room. He simply spoke over other people with a volume of words that was unfathomable. When he left the room to take a call, his team members erupted with frustration. It was obvious that this CEO was completely out of touch — something that became even more apparent later on, when he asked us to tell the board how positively he was responding to coaching.Leaders like this often ignore criticism if it doesn’t jibe with their view of themselves — and such feedback is easy to ignore if it’s buried in a performance review or mentioned briefly in a larger conversation. Conducting a non-judgmental, just-the-facts 360-degree review could help\\xa0them see the reality of\\xa0their\\xa0situation. Until\\xa0they can see what others see and why it matters,\\xa0they\\xa0won’t examine\\xa0their behavior, and coaching will be useless.2. You can’t get on their calendar.Some leaders claim to be receptive to coaching but just can’t find the time.\\xa0They may cancel sessions at the last minute, constantly reschedule, or, when\\xa0they do show up, be visibly distracted.\\xa0They lack space for coaching both in\\xa0their calendar, and in\\xa0their mind.Unlike the oblivious leader, the too-busy leader is often quite likable.\\xa0They will apologize for being hard to pin down, and be very direct about how busy they are. Don’t be surprised if\\xa0they’re flattered to be offered coaching. But coaching can’t be crammed into the schedule of a leader who wears\\xa0their busy-ness as a badge of honor. Their\\xa0inability to prioritize is a sign\\xa0they need coaching, but\\xa0their unwillingness to make room for it suggests\\xa0they won’t be a good coaching investment.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"DFP_IC_pos3\"); });A brilliant engineer we know had been promoted three times in four years, and by the time he was nearly 30 he was a group president at a U.S. manufacturing company. Diligent, humble, and smart, he could hold a room spellbound with only a marker and a whiteboard as he worked out solutions to highly technical problems. However, as adept as he was at the technical aspects of his job, he now had 20 people reporting to him whom he had no idea how to manage.After three months of coaching, his superiors could see it was going nowhere. The executive often rescheduled his sessions, telling his coach he didn’t have the time. He believed he couldn’t set aside the time to improve himself. That made him uncoachable.HR managers should do some reality testing to ensure the too-busy leader is willing to make room for coaching. To benefit from coaching, too-busy leaders must make the space to be fully present, both during the coaching sessions and after, doing the difficult work of developing new mindsets, skills, and habits. Ask this person what tasks or responsibilities they’d be willing to give up or delegate, even temporarily, to make time for coaching. If they struggle to think of any, give them a gentle but firm ultimatum as part of a career planning conversation: that\\xa0they have plateaued at the company and won’t go to the next level until\\xa0they make time for self-development.3. They focus too much on tips and tactics. Some leaders eagerly agree to coaching, but then avoid the deeper inquiries required for meaningful transformation. They’re willing to modify behaviors, but not beliefs. They view coaching as medicine that, if taken regularly, will help them get ahead.The quick-fix leader becomes frustrated when\\xa0their coach asks questions that require self-reflection.\\xa0They want answers, not questions. “You’re the expert, you tell me,”\\xa0they’ll say in response to questions from the coach, or “What if I did this?” Everything comes back to tactics. (A related warning sign is if a leader asks how quickly the coaching can be finished — especially if\\xa0they demand that the cycle be compressed.)Although coaches sometimes offer suggestions, their real job is to help executives uncover the assumptions driving their behavior. Only then can a coach help them challenge self-limiting beliefs that block their development. However, the quick-fix leader has little interest in this process.One CEO we worked with was leading a family business that had recently been sold to a large company. He was told by a leader in the new parent company (who himself had benefitted from coaching) that coaching would help him make the transition. The CEO gladly accepted, wanting to be seen as a peer.However, it wasn’t long into the first coaching session that he showed his entire focus was on “doing whatever other successful people did.” The coach worked tirelessly to shift the conversation to the CEO’s purpose and goals. Each time, however, he shifted the discussion back to the “secrets of success” of other organizational leaders he wanted to emulate. Ultimately, he was passed over for a permanent role on the parent company’s leadership team, and left the organization.To prompt this kind of leader to be open to self-reflection, remind\\xa0them of all the other times\\xa0they vowed to change but\\xa0were unsuccessful.\\xa0They then might realize\\xa0they need to work on more than just changing\\xa0their game plan. Or, introduce\\xa0them into a preliminary mentoring conversation with one of the leaders\\xa0they admire. Tell the mentor to share\\xa0their\\xa0experience of struggling to develop.4. They delay getting started with a coach to “do more research” or “find the right person.”To be sure, it’s important to have a good fit between a leader and his coach. But a continual rejection of qualified coaches should give you pause. A related red flag is if the person is acting confused, and asking repeatedly why coaching has been suggested. Assuming you’ve clearly explained why coaching is necessary, this could be a defense mechanism and a signal that the person is not ready to confront\\xa0their shortcomings. It usually stems from insecurity.Being coached can be daunting, and not everyone is ready to take it on. We remember a physician leader who was hired to turn around a business unit of a large medical center. When his staff challenged him, he became emotional. Told by his boss that he needed a coach to help him control his emotions, he was hurt and angrily asked “Why?” — failing again to control his emotions. He was too full of hidden fears for the coaching to be useful. His boss eventually reassigned him, and ultimately he left the organization.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"DFP_IC_pos4\"); });Reframe coaching as an investment the organization is making in\\xa0their development rather than a personal fix. Tell\\xa0them your firm provides this resource for high-potential, top performers to accelerate their success. If this leader can view coaching as something positive to help\\xa0them achieve\\xa0their goals,\\xa0they may warm up to the process.When Going Coach-Less Is Not Viable After hearing us say that a certain leader is not a good candidate for coaching, an executive who brought us in will often say a variant of this: “Well, he must be coached. We can’t let him continue to manage others the way he has, but we can’t fire him easily either because we need his skills badly.” But imposing coaching on someone who just can’t handle it at the moment isn’t going to help anyone.\\xa0Companies are better off directing their people development investments elsewhere\\xa0— skills training or academic programs\\xa0are often better options.Invest your coaching budget in people who have shown the willingness and the capacity to change, and you’ll get a much better return on your investment.', 'googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\'DFP_TITLE_pos2\\'); });Loading...Executive SummaryHow do those who control the coaching purse strings\\xa0— HR, talent managers, and other buyers\\xa0— avoid throwing money away on uncoachable executives?

In fact, we have seen many companies waste considerable sums by assigning coaches to managers who just aren’t ready to be coached, no matter how effective the coaches may be.So how do those who control the coaching purse strings\\xa0— HR, talent managers, and other buyers\\xa0— avoid throwing money away on uncoachable executives? Considering that a year’s engagement with a top executive coach can cost more than $100,000, it’s an important question.From nearly 35 years of coaching hundreds of executives, our firm has noticed a pattern of red flags that indicate when a coaching investment will be wasted. Here are\\xa0four things to watch out for:1. They blame external factors for their problems.When things go wrong, does this person always have an excuse? Maybe they point a finger at the quality of their team, a lack of resources, or even their boss.When leaders argue about the validity of your reasons for offering coaching, or offer excuses or defenses for poor results, it can be a sign that they lack self-awareness. Before any coaching can be effective,\\xa0they need to wake up to the ways\\xa0their actions affect others.One CEO we worked with was known for his smart turnarounds of a large media company. But he was struggling to get along with his executive team. Finally, several board directors suggested he should seek out a coach. After multiple sessions, he had shared little information about himself, and we were no closer to figuring out the root of the problem. Stymied, we suggested that we observe the next executive team meeting.Suddenly, all was clear. We were shocked by how he controlled the conversation in the room. He simply spoke over other people with a volume of words that was unfathomable. When he left the room to take a call, his team members erupted with frustration. It was obvious that this CEO was completely out of touch — something that became even more apparent later on, when he asked us to tell the board how positively he was responding to coaching.Leaders like this often ignore criticism if it doesn’t jibe with their view of themselves — and such feedback is easy to ignore if it’s buried in a performance review or mentioned briefly in a larger conversation. Conducting a non-judgmental, just-the-facts 360-degree review could help\\xa0them see the reality of\\xa0their\\xa0situation. Until\\xa0they can see what others see and why it matters,\\xa0they\\xa0won’t examine\\xa0their behavior, and coaching will be useless.2. You can’t get on their calendar.Some leaders claim to be receptive to coaching but just can’t find the time.\\xa0They may cancel sessions at the last minute, constantly reschedule, or, when\\xa0they do show up, be visibly distracted.\\xa0They lack space for coaching both in\\xa0their calendar, and in\\xa0their mind.Unlike the oblivious leader, the too-busy leader is often quite likable.\\xa0They will apologize for being hard to pin down, and be very direct about how busy they are. Don’t be surprised if\\xa0they’re flattered to be offered coaching. But coaching can’t be crammed into the schedule of a leader who wears\\xa0their busy-ness as a badge of honor. Their\\xa0inability to prioritize is a sign\\xa0they need coaching, but\\xa0their unwillingness to make room for it suggests\\xa0they won’t be a good coaching investment.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"DFP_IC_pos3\"); });A brilliant engineer we know had been promoted three times in four years, and by the time he was nearly 30 he was a group president at a U.S. manufacturing company. Diligent, humble, and smart, he could hold a room spellbound with only a marker and a whiteboard as he worked out solutions to highly technical problems. However, as adept as he was at the technical aspects of his job, he now had 20 people reporting to him whom he had no idea how to manage.After three months of coaching, his superiors could see it was going nowhere. The executive often rescheduled his sessions, telling his coach he didn’t have the time. He believed he couldn’t set aside the time to improve himself. That made him uncoachable.HR managers should do some reality testing to ensure the too-busy leader is willing to make room for coaching. To benefit from coaching, too-busy leaders must make the space to be fully present, both during the coaching sessions and after, doing the difficult work of developing new mindsets, skills, and habits. Ask this person what tasks or responsibilities they’d be willing to give up or delegate, even temporarily, to make time for coaching. If they struggle to think of any, give them a gentle but firm ultimatum as part of a career planning conversation: that\\xa0they have plateaued at the company and won’t go to the next level until\\xa0they make time for self-development.3. They focus too much on tips and tactics. Some leaders eagerly agree to coaching, but then avoid the deeper inquiries required for meaningful transformation. They’re willing to modify behaviors, but not beliefs. They view coaching as medicine that, if taken regularly, will help them get ahead.The quick-fix leader becomes frustrated when\\xa0their coach asks questions that require self-reflection.\\xa0They want answers, not questions. “You’re the expert, you tell me,”\\xa0they’ll say in response to questions from the coach, or “What if I did this?” Everything comes back to tactics. (A related warning sign is if a leader asks how quickly the coaching can be finished — especially if\\xa0they demand that the cycle be compressed.)Although coaches sometimes offer suggestions, their real job is to help executives uncover the assumptions driving their behavior. Only then can a coach help them challenge self-limiting beliefs that block their development. However, the quick-fix leader has little interest in this process.One CEO we worked with was leading a family business that had recently been sold to a large company. He was told by a leader in the new parent company (who himself had benefitted from coaching) that coaching would help him make the transition. The CEO gladly accepted, wanting to be seen as a peer.However, it wasn’t long into the first coaching session that he showed his entire focus was on “doing whatever other successful people did.” The coach worked tirelessly to shift the conversation to the CEO’s purpose and goals. Each time, however, he shifted the discussion back to the “secrets of success” of other organizational leaders he wanted to emulate. Ultimately, he was passed over for a permanent role on the parent company’s leadership team, and left the organization.To prompt this kind of leader to be open to self-reflection, remind\\xa0them of all the other times\\xa0they vowed to change but\\xa0were unsuccessful.\\xa0They then might realize\\xa0they need to work on more than just changing\\xa0their game plan. Or, introduce\\xa0them into a preliminary mentoring conversation with one of the leaders\\xa0they admire. Tell the mentor to share\\xa0their\\xa0experience of struggling to develop.4. They delay getting started with a coach to “do more research” or “find the right person.”To be sure, it’s important to have a good fit between a leader and his coach. But a continual rejection of qualified coaches should give you pause. A related red flag is if the person is acting confused, and asking repeatedly why coaching has been suggested. Assuming you’ve clearly explained why coaching is necessary, this could be a defense mechanism and a signal that the person is not ready to confront\\xa0their shortcomings. It usually stems from insecurity.Being coached can be daunting, and not everyone is ready to take it on. We remember a physician leader who was hired to turn around a business unit of a large medical center. When his staff challenged him, he became emotional. Told by his boss that he needed a coach to help him control his emotions, he was hurt and angrily asked “Why?” — failing again to control his emotions. He was too full of hidden fears for the coaching to be useful. His boss eventually reassigned him, and ultimately he left the organization.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"DFP_IC_pos4\"); });Reframe coaching as an investment the organization is making in\\xa0their development rather than a personal fix. Tell\\xa0them your firm provides this resource for high-potential, top performers to accelerate their success. If this leader can view coaching as something positive to help\\xa0them achieve\\xa0their goals,\\xa0they may warm up to the process.When Going Coach-Less Is Not Viable After hearing us say that a certain leader is not a good candidate for coaching, an executive who brought us in will often say a variant of this: “Well, he must be coached. We can’t let him continue to manage others the way he has, but we can’t fire him easily either because we need his skills badly.” But imposing coaching on someone who just can’t handle it at the moment isn’t going to help anyone.\\xa0Companies are better off directing their people development investments elsewhere\\xa0— skills training or academic programs\\xa0are often better options.Invest your coaching budget in people who have shown the willingness and the capacity to change, and you’ll get a much better return on your investment.']}\n",

By 2003 he could no longer speak intelligibly or walk,\\xa0so he\\xa0began managing his coaching relationships exclusively through written dialogue. Rosen and his clients initially thought that the lack of in-person interaction might get in the way of open dialogue, but that hasn’t been the case. They have discovered several unexpected advantages of coaching through writing, such as increased psychological safety, better “listening,” and greater accountability. Others can reap these benefits in a variety of coaching contexts from leadership development to organizational consulting to professional mentoring even if they aren’t similarly constrained by a handicap. To do so, they should signal open access and flexibility, manage confidentiality and\\xa0the flow of feedback, hone their written voice, and get comfortable with personal disclosure.   Marion Barraud for HBR  I was diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease) in 2001. By 2003 I could no longer speak intelligibly or walk, and any muscle control became more difficult as the disease progressed. I knew I couldn’t keep facilitating team meetings and giving strategy presentations staples of the consulting services I had provided for many years. But I still loved my work and needed to stay active, and my clients were open to trying a new approach, so I began managing my coaching relationships exclusively through written dialogue in instant messages, emails, and other electronic documents.This started out as a tentative experiment. My clients and I were skeptical at best about how it would go. We assumed that the lack of in-person interaction would get in the way of open dialogue. But that hasn’t been the case at all. In fact, we’ve discovered several unexpected advantages. I’ll describe those and share some practical guidelines so that others can reap them in a variety of coaching contexts from leadership development to organizational consulting to professional mentoring even if they aren’t similarly constrained by a handicap.Why Do It?As you’d imagine, the written communication enhances accessibility, because people can fire off an email and then schedule a follow-up chat session if one is needed. The gains are both tangible (quicker feedback and action for time-sensitive problem solving) and intangible (the increased confidence and peace of mind that come with feeling immediately heard and validated).But there are some surprising benefits, too. For one, coaching through writing can increase psychological safety, which leads to greater disclosure and builds trust. Before my ALS diagnosis, it often took two to three months of meetings and phone calls to establish a close connection. Now clients open up more quickly. In coaching various managing directors’ teams at a large investment bank, for example, I found that people shared personal stories (some funny, some embarrassing, some gut-wrenching), discussed thorny problems they were having with their managers (often my senior clients), and raised sensitive career management questions all within a month of weekly instant-message sessions. Clients consistently tell me that written dialogue makes it easier to be candid about what they’re grappling with. Without someone looking at them, they feel freer to express themselves and less concerned about criticism.Communicating entirely through writing also inhibits stereotyping on the basis of physical attractiveness, how people speak and present themselves, their body language, and so on. Even when I am told that a new client is unlikable or unapproachable or downright negative, I can build a strong connection. I attribute this largely to limited interpersonal noise. Instant messaging (IM) approaches 100% content (though emojis and writing styles try to approximate body language and vocal inflection). All around, there’s less “packaging” to skew your or your client’s perception of the messages exchanged. Though we do judge others on how they write, a casual medium like IM can mitigate this. We make allowances for people in informal written interaction.You and Your Team SeriesCommunication  How to Work with a Bad Listener Rebecca Knight 8 Ways to Get a Difficult Conversation Back on Track Monique Valcour Stop Trying to Sound Smart When You’re Writing Liane DaveyAnd many of us do a better job of listening in writing (as long as we’re making an effort), both in real time and upon reflection. Without the visual or auditory distractions or the pressure of having the other person in the room, we can better focus on what’s being said. I initially expected that instant messaging might be too slow. But clients say they like having more time to listen, absorb, think, and respond during a conversation, even in cultures that prize speed and urgency. It makes the communication more precise, which prevents confusion and misunderstandings later on and speeds up alignment for effective problem solving. Of course, both the coach and the client must be comfortable with responses like “hmm, am thinking” and “can you clarify?” during IM sessions, but that comes with practice as mutual respect and trust grow.In my experience, coaching through writing can help people manage highly charged emotions. Take, for instance, my IM exchanges with a technology manager at a financial services firm. He wanted to advance in his career, but he thought his stormy relationship with his boss was holding him back. We needed to develop a strategy for how he could better engage with his manager and highlight the value of his contributions. But to get into a constructive frame of mind, he had to vent first, and IM turned out to be a great tool for that. The act of writing his frustrations down and looking at the words on the screen seemed to help him move past them. It was almost like a journaling exercise: I read and acknowledged how he felt, but without judging it. (“Listening” in writing also enabled more patience on my part than if we had met in person.) When he finished unloading, he was ready to get to work.Finally, there’s the impact on accountability: Research shows that we’re more likely to achieve our goals when we write them down. The power of written declaration may seem fleeting in instant messaging, but the notes reflect present “objective truth” and make it harder to later forget or distort what was said. Clients tell me they actually welcome these conversations that feel more on the record, because they want to make progress on their goals, and the “record” can help measure that. Every conversation is automatically documented, so details are more easily recalled without the kind of follow-up, “just to recap” notes that can make people feel misunderstood or criticized. In addition, as clients have pointed out, the written record also holds me accountable for any ground rules we’ve established and follow-up commitments I’ve made.How to Do ItWhether you simply want to increase the amount of coaching you do through writing to reap these benefits or you’ve decided to go all-in because of life circumstances, as I’ve done, here are some principles I’ve gleaned over the past 14 years. Though these basic guidelines can be applied to all business relationships, they’ve especially helped me in my remote work with clients.Signal open access and flexibility. On the front end of any coaching relationship, it is essential to convey credible commitment and caring. I do this in various ways: Before a first session, I send out my bio and a proposed agenda, and then allow plenty of time for a new client to ask about my background, my perspective on coaching, and my experience in using IM. I invite people to ask personal questions, too. Next, I say that I am available anytime, to signal my commitment to a needs-driven (versus schedule-driven) arrangement that enables timely feedback, problem solving, action commitments, and learning. Coaching through writing makes it easier to deliver on that promise, and making myself always available provides peace of mind for the client. The main message I’m sending is “Hey, I am here for you and totally committed to you.” I always want to know if a client needs me (or thinks they\\xa0do) beyond our scheduled meeting times. If a pattern of problematic dependence on me were to emerge (it never has), IM and other written communication would help me identify that pattern and address it.Manage confidentiality. I’ve observed that clients worry less about confidentiality issues when they’re coached through written exchanges, and I think that has a lot to do with setting clear expectations. I never make a blanket promise to keep mum. Rather, at the beginning of an engagement I ask the client to trust my judgment to share anything that I see as a potential win for them. But I also say that if the client wants something specific to be kept between us, I’ll honor that request. You might think people would feel vulnerable in an arrangement like that, but most say they are comfortable giving me latitude to make judgment calls, and they become more and more so as the relationship develops. They know it’s up to them to flag anything that isn’t meant to be shared, and they do so.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"DFP_IC_pos3\"); });Manage the feedback flow. As both a team consultant and a coach to individual team members, I help people build strong interpersonal and work relationships. In the process, I learn what they think about one another. So from the outset, I make it clear that part of my role is to improve feedback flow within the group, because that will allow for more team cohesion and individual growth and development. Since much of what people share with me is sensitive, however, I’m very careful about what I convey and to whom. Issues can be politically hot and even explosive if mishandled.When colleagues write positive things about one another, I pass that feedback along verbatim, because the emotional impact is stronger that way. When the comments are negative, my interventions can be quite different. Sometimes I keep information to myself as important context, especially for dealing with conflicts that may come up later. And sometimes I “translate” emotionally evocative criticisms, framing them more constructively in order to diminish potential defensiveness and maximize learning. If the culture is one where people view their teammates negatively and are reluctant to speak up on their own, I may try to serve as a catalyst for “discussing the undiscussable,” to use organizational behavior theorist Chris Argyris’s phrase, by urging the critical team member to have a direct discussion with the other party. I may even offer to facilitate an exchange through three-way instant messaging.Hone your written voice. Informal language in writing can build camaraderie, but only if it feels natural. Imagine in your head how the words will sound to the receiver, and then write how you would speak them. It takes time to develop this skill and to do the extra thinking, but it forces you to empathize with people, and they’ll pick up on that. Spelling and mechanics don’t matter much in instant messaging, because such mistakes are easily forgiven and forgotten in real-time chats but in emails and other formal documents, attending to those details is essential for credibility.In the early stages of a coaching engagement, I usually stick with descriptive (rather than evaluative) language. New clients are generally more receptive to “This is what I see happening” than to “This is what I think you should be doing differently,” and it shows them, by example, how to think less judgmentally and more objectively. Once you’ve built a stronger relationship, you’ll have more latitude in offering constructive criticism; people will be less likely to perceive it as an attack. Still, ask permission first, and perhaps frame it as “If I were in your shoes, I might…” Written criticism can linger in misunderstanding; once it is typed, it is harder to take back than a spoken comment. The communications discipline will be well worth the effort.Get comfortable with personal disclosure. This may be the most important part of developing and maintaining an open, trusting relationship. We know from social exchange theory and studies on interpersonal communication that if an individual openly discloses thoughts and feelings to others, the other party is more likely to open up too. As I mentioned earlier, the perceived distance of coaching through writing doesn’t put up walls; it actually allows for freer dialogue, with fewer boundaries which further promotes trust. The coach and client may engage in a broader, more robust search for root causes of problems, for example, or they may communicate more candidly about what the client needs to do.Plus, a productive relationship of disclosure requires authenticity\\xa0— on both sides. If you model that as a coach, and it’s reciprocated, clients can then transfer what they have learned from you to all kinds of situations and relationships, both business and personal.', 'googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\\'DFP_TITLE_pos2\\'); });Loading...Executive SummaryMark Rosen was diagnosed with ALS in 2001.

In fact, we’ve discovered several unexpected advantages. I’ll describe those and share some practical guidelines so that others can reap them in a variety of coaching contexts from leadership development to organizational consulting to professional mentoring even if they aren’t similarly constrained by a handicap.Why Do It?As you’d imagine, the written communication enhances accessibility, because people can fire off an email and then schedule a follow-up chat session if one is needed. The gains are both tangible (quicker feedback and action for time-sensitive problem solving) and intangible (the increased confidence and peace of mind that come with feeling immediately heard and validated).But there are some surprising benefits, too. For one, coaching through writing can increase psychological safety, which leads to greater disclosure and builds trust. Before my ALS diagnosis, it often took two to three months of meetings and phone calls to establish a close connection. Now clients open up more quickly. In coaching various managing directors’ teams at a large investment bank, for example, I found that people shared personal stories (some funny, some embarrassing, some gut-wrenching), discussed thorny problems they were having with their managers (often my senior clients), and raised sensitive career management questions all within a month of weekly instant-message sessions. Clients consistently tell me that written dialogue makes it easier to be candid about what they’re grappling with. Without someone looking at them, they feel freer to express themselves and less concerned about criticism.Communicating entirely through writing also inhibits stereotyping on the basis of physical attractiveness, how people speak and present themselves, their body language, and so on. Even when I am told that a new client is unlikable or unapproachable or downright negative, I can build a strong connection. I attribute this largely to limited interpersonal noise. Instant messaging (IM) approaches 100% content (though emojis and writing styles try to approximate body language and vocal inflection). All around, there’s less “packaging” to skew your or your client’s perception of the messages exchanged. Though we do judge others on how they write, a casual medium like IM can mitigate this. We make allowances for people in informal written interaction.You and Your Team SeriesCommunication  How to Work with a Bad Listener Rebecca Knight 8 Ways to Get a Difficult Conversation Back on Track Monique Valcour Stop Trying to Sound Smart When You’re Writing Liane DaveyAnd many of us do a better job of listening in writing (as long as we’re making an effort), both in real time and upon reflection. Without the visual or auditory distractions or the pressure of having the other person in the room, we can better focus on what’s being said. I initially expected that instant messaging might be too slow. But clients say they like having more time to listen, absorb, think, and respond during a conversation, even in cultures that prize speed and urgency. It makes the communication more precise, which prevents confusion and misunderstandings later on and speeds up alignment for effective problem solving. Of course, both the coach and the client must be comfortable with responses like “hmm, am thinking” and “can you clarify?” during IM sessions, but that comes with practice as mutual respect and trust grow.In my experience, coaching through writing can help people manage highly charged emotions. Take, for instance, my IM exchanges with a technology manager at a financial services firm. He wanted to advance in his career, but he thought his stormy relationship with his boss was holding him back. We needed to develop a strategy for how he could better engage with his manager and highlight the value of his contributions. But to get into a constructive frame of mind, he had to vent first, and IM turned out to be a great tool for that. The act of writing his frustrations down and looking at the words on the screen seemed to help him move past them. It was almost like a journaling exercise: I read and acknowledged how he felt, but without judging it. (“Listening” in writing also enabled more patience on my part than if we had met in person.) When he finished unloading, he was ready to get to work.Finally, there’s the impact on accountability: Research shows that we’re more likely to achieve our goals when we write them down. The power of written declaration may seem fleeting in instant messaging, but the notes reflect present “objective truth” and make it harder to later forget or distort what was said. Clients tell me they actually welcome these conversations that feel more on the record, because they want to make progress on their goals, and the “record” can help measure that. Every conversation is automatically documented, so details are more easily recalled without the kind of follow-up, “just to recap” notes that can make people feel misunderstood or criticized. In addition, as clients have pointed out, the written record also holds me accountable for any ground rules we’ve established and follow-up commitments I’ve made.How to Do ItWhether you simply want to increase the amount of coaching you do through writing to reap these benefits or you’ve decided to go all-in because of life circumstances, as I’ve done, here are some principles I’ve gleaned over the past 14 years. Though these basic guidelines can be applied to all business relationships, they’ve especially helped me in my remote work with clients.Signal open access and flexibility. On the front end of any coaching relationship, it is essential to convey credible commitment and caring. I do this in various ways: Before a first session, I send out my bio and a proposed agenda, and then allow plenty of time for a new client to ask about my background, my perspective on coaching, and my experience in using IM. I invite people to ask personal questions, too. Next, I say that I am available anytime, to signal my commitment to a needs-driven (versus schedule-driven) arrangement that enables timely feedback, problem solving, action commitments, and learning. Coaching through writing makes it easier to deliver on that promise, and making myself always available provides peace of mind for the client. The main message I’m sending is “Hey, I am here for you and totally committed to you.” I always want to know if a client needs me (or thinks they\\xa0do) beyond our scheduled meeting times. If a pattern of problematic dependence on me were to emerge (it never has), IM and other written communication would help me identify that pattern and address it.Manage confidentiality. I’ve observed that clients worry less about confidentiality issues when they’re coached through written exchanges, and I think that has a lot to do with setting clear expectations. I never make a blanket promise to keep mum. Rather, at the beginning of an engagement I ask the client to trust my judgment to share anything that I see as a potential win for them. But I also say that if the client wants something specific to be kept between us, I’ll honor that request. You might think people would feel vulnerable in an arrangement like that, but most say they are comfortable giving me latitude to make judgment calls, and they become more and more so as the relationship develops. They know it’s up to them to flag anything that isn’t meant to be shared, and they do so.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"DFP_IC_pos3\"); });Manage the feedback flow. As both a team consultant and a coach to individual team members, I help people build strong interpersonal and work relationships. In the process, I learn what they think about one another. So from the outset, I make it clear that part of my role is to improve feedback flow within the group, because that will allow for more team cohesion and individual growth and development. Since much of what people share with me is sensitive, however, I’m very careful about what I convey and to whom. Issues can be politically hot and even explosive if mishandled.When colleagues write positive things about one another, I pass that feedback along verbatim, because the emotional impact is stronger that way. When the comments are negative, my interventions can be quite different. Sometimes I keep information to myself as important context, especially for dealing with conflicts that may come up later. And sometimes I “translate” emotionally evocative criticisms, framing them more constructively in order to diminish potential defensiveness and maximize learning. If the culture is one where people view their teammates negatively and are reluctant to speak up on their own, I may try to serve as a catalyst for “discussing the undiscussable,” to use organizational behavior theorist Chris Argyris’s phrase, by urging the critical team member to have a direct discussion with the other party. I may even offer to facilitate an exchange through three-way instant messaging.Hone your written voice. Informal language in writing can build camaraderie, but only if it feels natural. Imagine in your head how the words will sound to the receiver, and then write how you would speak them. It takes time to develop this skill and to do the extra thinking, but it forces you to empathize with people, and they’ll pick up on that. Spelling and mechanics don’t matter much in instant messaging, because such mistakes are easily forgiven and forgotten in real-time chats but in emails and other formal documents, attending to those details is essential for credibility.In the early stages of a coaching engagement, I usually stick with descriptive (rather than evaluative) language. New clients are generally more receptive to “This is what I see happening” than to “This is what I think you should be doing differently,” and it shows them, by example, how to think less judgmentally and more objectively. Once you’ve built a stronger relationship, you’ll have more latitude in offering constructive criticism; people will be less likely to perceive it as an attack. Still, ask permission first, and perhaps frame it as “If I were in your shoes, I might…” Written criticism can linger in misunderstanding; once it is typed, it is harder to take back than a spoken comment. The communications discipline will be well worth the effort.Get comfortable with personal disclosure. This may be the most important part of developing and maintaining an open, trusting relationship. We know from social exchange theory and studies on interpersonal communication that if an individual openly discloses thoughts and feelings to others, the other party is more likely to open up too. As I mentioned earlier, the perceived distance of coaching through writing doesn’t put up walls; it actually allows for freer dialogue, with fewer boundaries which further promotes trust. The coach and client may engage in a broader, more robust search for root causes of problems, for example, or they may communicate more candidly about what the client needs to do.Plus, a productive relationship of disclosure requires authenticity\\xa0— on both sides. If you model that as a coach, and it’s reciprocated, clients can then transfer what they have learned from you to all kinds of situations and relationships, both business and personal.']}\n",
